Portfolio Website

Hello, this repo contains the two different portfolio websites I have made. 

The first is a standard website @[tom-sloan.com](https://www.tom-sloan.com). \
The second is a work in progress, however it is my attempt to make a more fun and interactive portfolio @[version2.tom-sloan.com](https://version2.tom-sloan.com)\

Both of these sites contain significant amounts of code that I made for fun, and is not really used (e.g. the first page has a landing page with an interactive physics engine). \
What I am trying to get at is if you copy the repo you are really getting all the little tests and branches I went through when trying to make a more interactive and playful user experience.


You'll notice that there are two contributers to this repo. This portfolio website originally contained the shared website I did when practising with a friend. However, if you look at the contributions graph you'll see that this has been an independant project for some time now.
