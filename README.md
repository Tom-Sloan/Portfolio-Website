## About

Robot Vision Engineer specializing in SLAM, computer vision, and drone-based 3D mapping systems. Expertise in AWS, Docker, Python, and embedded systems. Constantly working on projects to push the boundaries of autonomous systems and AI.

Currently working as a Researcher at Carleton University developing real-time indoor 3D mapping systems using consumer drones, cloud-based SLAM, and AR visualization. Previous experience includes DevOps engineering at Magnet Forensics and spectrum engineering at Telesat.

## Education

**Master of Applied Science - MASc**
Carleton University
Electrical and Computer Engineering
January 2024 - November 2025

Thesis: Indoor 3D Modeling Using Consumer Drones and Neural Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for Virtual Reality and a Cloud Architecture. Defending November 2025.

**Bachelor of Engineering - BE**
Carleton University
Computer Systems Engineering

## Experience

**Researcher**
Carleton University
October 2023 - Present

Leading the design and testing of a real-time indoor 3D mapping system using a consumer drone (DJI Mini 3), integrating monocular camera and IMU with cloud-based SLAM framework for AR applications. Implemented modular software architecture using Docker, RabbitMQ, and React.js to offload high-computation tasks to remote server, enabling real-time visualization on desktop and AR headsets.

**DevOps Engineer**
Magnet Forensics
April 2022 - June 2023

Worked in a small team environment using DevOps tools including Jenkins, Linux, Python and PowerShell to help manage thousands of software builds a day on dozens of on-premise servers. Helped with the migration from on-premise to AWS cloud using CloudFormation and EC2.

**Spectrum Engineering Co-Op**
Telesat
May 2020 - December 2021

Made an alternative user interface and API in Python to interact with MATLAB giving the ability to directly use satellite XML data without requiring expensive MATLAB add-ons. Wrote extensive tests and code to analyze satellite spectrum use for international telecommunications regulations.
