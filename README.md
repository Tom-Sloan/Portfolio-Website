Portfolio Website

Hello, this repo contains the two different portfolio websites I have made. 

The first is a standard website @[tom-sloan.com](https://www.tom-sloan.com). 
The second is a work in progress, however it is my attempt to make a more fun and interactive portfolio @[version2.tom-sloan.com](https://version2.tom-sloan.com)

Both of these sites contain significant amounts of code that I made for fun, and is not really used (e.g. the first page has a landing page with an interactive physics engine). 
What I am trying to get at is if you copy the repo you are really getting all the little tests and branches I went through when trying to make a more interactive and playful user experience.
