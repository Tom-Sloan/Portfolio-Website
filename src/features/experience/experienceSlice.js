This allowed an easier to use input interface for many MATLAB functions. This system was also able to receive and analyses all data that is returned to it using a very customizable plotting system. ",
            "Wrote a MATLAB interface to connect to a Python server that allowed for a variety of MATLAB functions (both native and user defined) to be called and returned all data in a proper format. This system contained extensive error checking and reliable feedback mechanisms. This system also was able to get around the native MATLAB deployment issue of requiring a MATLAB production server to have external GUIs running, allowing web applications and native apps to communicate easily with MATLAB.",

This allowed the further analysis of various international regulations tests such as regulation 1503 from the International Telecommunication Union. This code is vital for Telesat to operate its satellites within the bound of regulators and to ensure that various satellite operators are doing the same. ",
